ATTENDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


Attendance is a basic and most important criteria needed in all the education system.Attendance is used as a record to
assess student consistency in participate the class.Therefore, student is required to attend all teaching activities 
held by the institutions.Once attendance is below the required policy, the student will be subjected to further action
or suspended from taking the final exam depend on the respective institutions they are in. This impractical method will
lead to fraud on number of absentees by students. Beside, this method also easily allow for impersonation as some student
may purposely sign on another student’s name. Besides, lecturer needs to analyze manually every attendance sheet to identify
the number of absentees for both lecture and lab classes correspond to subject. Then, lecturer needs to count and calculate
percentage of present of all the students manually to identify when warning letter need to be given to the student depend on
his or her number of absents without providing any medical certificate or notice. As a result, it is time consuming, increase
number of works of the lecturer and prone to human error as it is difficult to ascertain whether the calculation made was correct.
Moreover, student needs to spend unnecessarily time during class session to sign on the attendance sheet. This also disturbing and
student may lose focus when the attendance sheet is passing around during the class session. Therefore, Student Attendance Management
System is proposed to help or reduce lecturer’s work. This system facilitates to access or manage the attendance information of all the
classes. Student by default is assumed to be present as number of present will be higher than the absentees for most of the attendance 
report. After that, lecturer is allowing to change or modify absentee’s attendance data. The system will automatically count the number
of absents and the percentage of present for all the students based on the subject classes. Once the number of absents exceed the 
attendance policy, appropriate warning letter will be generated automatically to be given to the absentee. Hence, this system 
provides a tedious work in maintaining attendance records besides saving time to analyze every attendance list and assuring
the calculation made was error-free.
